Wordpress api in JSON format

## Description

wp-api translates your whole wordpress blog into a JSON formatted api. you can use many different methods to retrieve 
information about posts, pages, authors, tags and categories. You may also use the api methods to submit new comments.

We had to write this plugin from ground up because we were working on an adobe air mobile project that required us to
show posts from a wordpress site! we're still upgrading the app and we need to upgrade this api even more also. so we 
decided to put it up on wordpress directory for everyone to use and have fun :)

to get detailed description on how to use the api, go to wp-api page from the 'settings' menu to see the methods and examples.

## Installation

1. Upload the `wp-api` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to `wp-api` page in the `Settings` menu

## Frequently Asked Questions
